## **📌 Levels Covered**  

### **✅ Basic (Step-by-Step Learning)**  
📌 **Level 1: Linear Prediction (No LSTM)**  
   - Uses a **basic neural network (`Dense`)** for simple regression.  
📌 **Level 2: Data Preprocessing for LSTM**  
   - Converts **sequential data** into a format suitable for LSTM models.  
📌 **Level 3: Basic LSTM Model**  
   - Introduces `LSTM` layers to learn sequence patterns.  
📌 **Level 4: Multi-Step Prediction**  
   - Predicts **multiple future values** instead of just one.  
📌 **Level 5: Using More Past Data**  
   - Uses **multiple past values** for better predictions.  

---

### **✅ Advanced LSTM Techniques**  
📌 **Many-to-One Prediction**  
   - Uses **multiple past time steps** to predict **one future value**.  
📌 **Many-to-Many Prediction**  
   - Predicts an **entire sequence** of future values.  
📌 **Multi-Step Prediction**  
   - Predicts **multiple future points in time**, useful for time series forecasting.  

---

### **✅ Real-World Applications**  
📌 **Sales Prediction**  
   - Predicts **future sales trends** based on historical data.  
📌 **Stock Price Forecasting**  
   - Uses **Yahoo Finance stock data** to predict market movements.
