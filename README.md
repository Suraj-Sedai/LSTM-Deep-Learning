# 📊 LSTM Sequence Prediction with TensorFlow

## 🔥 Overview
This repository provides a **step-by-step learning guide** for sequence prediction using **TensorFlow and LSTM**. It starts with simple **linear regression models** and progresses to **multi-step LSTM-based predictions**.

## 📌 Levels Covered
### ✅ Level 1: Linear Prediction (No LSTM)
- Uses a basic neural network (`Dense`) to predict simple values.

### ✅ Level 2: Data Preprocessing for LSTM
- Converts a number sequence into a format suitable for LSTM models.

### ✅ Level 3: Basic LSTM Model
- Introduces `LSTM` layers to predict sequential patterns.

### ✅ Level 4: Multi-Step Prediction
- Predicts multiple future values instead of just one.

### ✅ Level 5: Using More Past Data
- Uses **3 past values** to predict the next in a sequence.
